# Project Description
This is an android app called Product Finder which allows users to find products they need online and purchase them,
it was created using android and java.

# How to access Product Finder
Product Finder is not yet available on the play store or anywhere else you can download, but if you got android Studio, just clone it and run in your device, you'll need your own API key for it to work, so grab yourself any Marketing API like Walmart.
